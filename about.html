                Dear Player,<br><br>
                Life, much like this game, is full of challenges. You'll encounter obstacles, some large and some small, but each one is an opportunity to learn and grow. Don’t be afraid to fail, for every mistake brings wisdom. It’s not about reaching the end without falling; it’s about picking yourself up and trying again. Remember, persistence is key—each bounce, each break, brings you closer to mastery. Keep going, and let the journey teach you, not just the destination.<br><br>
                With belief in your potential,<br>
